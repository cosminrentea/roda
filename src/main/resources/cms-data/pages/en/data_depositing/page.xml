	<b>Data depositing</b></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A social data archive 
	is an institution beneficial for the entire academic community, both for the users and 
	equally also for any persons or institutions wanting to deposit the data.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the world, and 
	Romania makes no exception, the data producers try to protect them, either from the competition 
	or simply because large amounts of money were spent to collect them. Depositing data to RODA
	would look at the first sight a loss of control, the owner becoming uncertain about the final 
	destination of data.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RODA helps the data owners 
	who want to deposit them, by two complementary solutions:</font></p>

<div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><ul>
	<li>confidentiality contracts;</li>
	<li>the owners can use their passwords to directly control the access level for one dataset
		or another.</li>
</ul></font></div>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What should be understood from 
	the very beginning is that depositing the data does not mean losing their control. On the 
	contrary, all rights will remain to the owners who will mention them in the access conditions; 
	the archive does nothing else but administrating the data in favour of the owner, serving as 
	a mediator between the data owner and the data user.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have social science 
	databases that can be used (subject to the previously mentioned conditions), please consider 
	depositing such data to RODA.</font></p>
